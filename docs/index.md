#### PineSAM = Pinecil Settings and Menus

Why focus on soldering when you can play with the settings instead? With this app you have full control over your new shiny Pinecil V2 from your computer using bluetooth.

**NB**: No special browser BLE GATT or flags required and works on all major OS/devices.

**NB**: This app needs the python backend to run on a computer, it CANNOT run entirely in the browser like Joric's UI.

## :signal_strength: Remote access

You can access the settings remotely once the app is running on the main PC/laptop.

* Find the [local IP address](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-find-your-local-and-external-ip-address-5833108) of the device running the app.
* open `http://<ip-address>:8080/` on the second device on the same network (e.g., a phone).
* Pinecil needs to be within BLE range of the computer running the PineSAM app.



## üõ†Ô∏è Running Unit tests
