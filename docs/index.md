Why focus on soldering when you can play with the settings instead? With this app you have full control over your new shiny Pinecil V2 from your computer using bluetooth.

**NB**: No special browser BLE GATT or flags required and works on all major OS/devices.

**NB**: This app needs the python backend to run on a computer, it CANNOT run entirely in the browser like Joric's UI.

-  Work HUD main screen with: Set 째C/째F `[+][-]` buttons, live tip 째C/째F updates, peak watts, live watts, input voltage.
-  Preset buttons to allow quick change of user defined temperatures (PineSAM extra feature not available directly inside Pinecil).
-  Backend runs locally on all major platforms/OS while the user interface runs on your favorite browser.

## :signal_strength: Remote access

You can access the settings remotely once the app is running on the main PC/laptop.

* Find the [local IP address](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-find-your-local-and-external-ip-address-5833108) of the device running the app.
* open `http://<ip-address>:8080/` on the second device on the same network (e.g., a phone).
* Pinecil needs to be within BLE range of the computer running the PineSAM app.
