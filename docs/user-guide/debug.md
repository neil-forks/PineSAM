# Debug Data

- Debug is a special category in Pinecil that is usually hidden and not used unless troubleshooting an issue.
- On Pinecil, the debug menu is accesed by long hold ++minus++ and then use the ++plus++ to scroll through the values (see here).
- PineSAM currently displays the raw values as sent by the Pinecil and does no change to the values; therefore, these may not match exactly what you see on the Pinecil Debug screen.
- Not all values are available yet, e.g., PD Debug values can only be seen on Pinecil.
- Debug functions are listed in [Ralim's IronOS here](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/DebugMenu/).
